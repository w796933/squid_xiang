squid-docker-simple-auth
========================

A simple (and fragile) Dockerfile for launching an authenticated squid proxy.

The user must specify authentication credentials via the following environment variables:

```
SQUID_USERNAME=foo
SQUID_PASSWORD=bar
```

An example invocation would be:

```
docker run -e SQUID_USERNAME=foo -e SQUID_PASSWORD=bar -p 3128:3128 robhaswell/squid-authenticated
```

With some added performance improvements and transparency settings.
Latest version of Squid.

Uses Alpine Linux.
